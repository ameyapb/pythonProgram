**Python Automation Project: File Sorting**
The Python automation project for Windows 10 allows you to sort files based on their extensions. The program helps you organize files into different categories for better file management. It supports the following types of extensions: Text, Images, Docs, and Others.

The program works as follows:

- It scans a specified directory (e.g., a folder) on your Windows 10 system.
- It identifies files in that directory and extracts their file extensions.
- Based on the file extensions, it categorizes the files into different folders or directories.
- Files with extensions like .txt, .csv, and others related to text are moved to the Text folder.
- Files with image extensions like .jpg, .png, etc., are moved to the Images folder.
- Files with document extensions like .doc, .pdf, etc., are moved to the Docs folder.
- Files with other extensions that don't match the above categories are moved to the Others folder.

By running this automation project, you can quickly organize and sort files on your Windows 10 system based on their extensions, making it easier to locate and manage files of different types.

**Python Calculator**
The calculator program allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator program works as follows:

- It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation choice.
- The user enters the first number, the second number, and selects the desired operation.
- Based on the selected operation, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic calculation.
- The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.
- For example, if the user enters the numbers 5 and 3 and selects addition as the operation, the program will calculate and display the result as 8.

The calculator program provides a simple and convenient way to perform basic calculations using Python. You can extend its functionality by adding more operations or enhancing the user interface.

Both of these Python programs demonstrate practical applications of Python in automation and calculation tasks, showcasing the versatility and ease of use of the language for such purposes.
